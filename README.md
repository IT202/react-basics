# react-basics

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and because it is widely used, you want to become familiar with the basics.

You'll find some good tutorials on the basics created by Kirupa Chinnathambi and his team at https://www.kirupa.com/react/

This repo has an empty file for your work on the first several tutorials;  work through those, updating the appropriate file.  If a tutorial continues from the prior one, just copy over the file contents as a starting point for the next tutorial.





The React site is https://facebook.github.io/react/
